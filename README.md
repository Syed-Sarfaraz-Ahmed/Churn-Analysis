# Churn-Analysis
 the telecom Retention Manager has scheduled a meeting with the engagement partner at PwC to cover these points:

-- Customers in the telecom industry are hard-earned: we don’t want to lose them
-- The retention department is here to get customers back in case of termination 
-- Currently, we get in touch after they have terminated the contract, but this is reactionary: it would be better to know in advance who is at risk 
-- We  have done customer analysis with Excel: it has always ended in a dead-end
-- We would like to know more about our customers: visualised clearly so that it’s self-explanatory for our management
-- The Retentions Manager has provided some information, have a look through the resource section.

Your Task,
1. Define proper KPIs
2. Create a dashboard for the retention manager reflecting the KPIs
3. Write a short email to him (the engagement partner) explaining your findings, and include suggestions as to what needs to be changed

As part of my PwC Virtual Internship, I created a dashboard in Power BI that reflects all relevant Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and metrics in the dataset.
